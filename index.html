                            <p>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010 and debuting in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own material. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres; their lyrics have often discussed mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, and individualism.</p>
                            <p>Their work also frequently references literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.</p>

                            BTS, which consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, has achieved a number of achievements, even breaking world records. Their popularity makes BTS members’ personal lives also attract curiosity when it comes to their family as their number one support system.

                        One of the slightly underrated friendships from BTS is between leader RM and Jin (or Namjin) as they are referred to. BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, V, Jimin and Jungkook appear to share an equally close friendship with each other, but ARMY has their own 'ship' biases.
